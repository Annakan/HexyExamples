# Hexy Example

This repo contains an graphical example of how someone might use `hexy`.

#### Running the example

Go the project root directory and run the following:

```bash
git clone http://github.com/redft/hexyexamples
cd hexyexamples
pip install -r requirements.txt
python2 example.py
```

The example app just shows off some features of the library. To play around you can:

```
- right click to change the hex selection type. 
- scroll up and down to change the radius of selection when selection type is ring or disk.
- left click to change the starting point of the line when selection type is a line.
```
